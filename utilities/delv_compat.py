"""Make the delvmod package importable on modern Python.

delvmod is a 2014-era Python 2 library. Two things stop it importing on a
modern Python, and both are handled here, from *outside* the checkout --
nothing in delvmod is ever edited, because it is the correctness
oracle and an oracle you have patched is not one.

  * **parsley**, a PEG parser that is not installed. delv/rdasm.py imports it
    at module scope (rdasm.py:900) but only touches it inside
    Assembler.__init__, and delv/__init__.py pulls rdasm in -- so importing
    anything at all fails without it. Reading and disassembling archives never
    builds an assembler, so a stub that defers the failure to the point of use
    keeps the rest of delv working. **This one is still required.**
  * **inspect.getargspec**, removed in 3.11, which rdasm.py used at import time
    to derive assembler operand rules. The checkout this repository points at
    -- ratlizard/delvmod, the maintainer's fork -- fixes this internally at rdasm.py:65, so
    the shim below is dead code against it and is kept only so that $DELVMOD
    can point at an unpatched upstream checkout and still work.

If that ever stops being true and delvmod imports clean, delete this file and
the one import in utilities/delv_graphics_ref.py. It exists to be unnecessary.

Two ways to use it. Import it for its side effects and then use delv normally:

    import tools.delv_compat            # or: import delv_compat
    import delv.archive

or, when the caller resolves the delvmod path itself (as
utilities/delv_graphics_ref.py does, from its command line), take just the
shims:

    from tools.delv_compat import install_shims
    sys.path.insert(0, delv_path)
    install_shims()

Set $DELVMOD to use a delvmod checkout kept outside this repository.
