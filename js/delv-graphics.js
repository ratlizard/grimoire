/* delv-graphics.js -- Cythera's palette, its compressed-graphics decoder, and
 * the undither filter, from bytes to pixels and no further.
 *
 * Nothing in here touches the DOM. decompressDCG() and decodeResource() return
 * a plain Uint8Array of palette indices; undither() takes and returns RGBA
 * arrays. Drawing those onto a canvas is the page's job and stays there, which
 * is what makes this file checkable: utilities/delv_graphics_check.mjs runs
 * delvmod's independent decoder over every image in the archive and compares
 * pixel for pixel, and utilities/decoder_snapshot.mjs hashes the output so a
 * refactor that changes a byte is visible. Keep new code here on the same side
 * of that line -- a decoder that needs a canvas cannot be compared against a
 * Python one.
 *
 * See delv-archive.js for why these are classic scripts and why this is
 * organisation rather than a library. LOAD ORDER: after delv-archive.js, whose
 * bit readers decodeResource() uses; before the page.
 *
 * ABOUT THE PALETTE, before anyone corrects it: this table differs from the
 * application's own `clut` 256 at exactly two entries, index 0 and index 247,
 * and both differences are absorbed by the `>> 2` in scale6to8 -- the rendered
 * pixels are identical either way. The comment above scale6to8 explains why
 * the widening is done by scaling rather than the shift the original used.
 *
 * The undither block is the settled result of a long tuning exercise, and
 * mobile.html carries a port of it as three GPU passes because this
 * implementation costs 5.8 s for a 640x480 frame. utilities/
 * mobile_undither_check.mjs reads UD and the detector's constants back out of
 * this file and fails if the two have drifted, so a tuning change made here
 * without touching mobile.html is caught rather than discovered later.

/* One resource in subindex 141 is not a tile sheet at all.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   0x8EFF -- the wiki's "Tombstone" -- was being decompressed as the fixed
   32x512 strip every other 0x8Exx resource is, which produced a sheared mess:
   its rows are 196 pixels long, so reading them 32 at a time walks diagonally
   through the picture. It is a SIZED resource, the same 4-byte {width, height}
   header subindex 142 uses, and it decodes to a 194x127 tombstone slab -- the
   panel the game lays a gravestone inscription on.

   Two things have to hold before the header reading is used, and across all
   160 tile sheets in the archive only 0x8EFF passes both:

     * the header parses to a plausible picture (every other sheet's first four
       bytes read as sizes like 61693x128 or 20x61185 -- they are compression
       opcodes, not a header; only 0x8E8D at 272x46 and 0x8EFF at 194x127 are
       even arguable), and
     * none of the sixteen tile ids the sheet would occupy carries any tile
       attribute in 0xF002. 0x8E8D's sixteen are all attributed and all named
       ("earthen wall", "small hole", "fine wire"...) and all referenced by
       maps; 0x8EFF's sixteen are attributed nowhere and referenced by nothing.

   Row-to-row self-similarity confirms the reading: 0.58 flat against 0.82 at

   Checkerboard notch.

   Where this artwork is dithered, the dither is usually a checkerboard — but
   not in brightness, which is why it hides from a luminance analysis. It is a
   checkerboard in WHICH RAMP each pixel is taken from: neutral greys
   interleaved with warm browns to make a desaturated skin tone. The two are
   close in lightness and far apart in hue, so the pattern is loud to the eye
   and nearly invisible to any measurement of luma.

   Measured on the choice itself, as a grey-or-brown indicator, 56% of the
   mixed patches in 0x8809 and 45% in Pelagon peak at exactly the checkerboard
   frequency. Others, like 0x8801, have almost none — it varies by resource.

   A checkerboard is the single frequency (pi,pi), so it can be removed by a
   filter that is zero there and one at DC instead of by a blur that attenuates
   everything. Half the centre plus half the mean of the four orthogonal
   neighbours does exactly that: the neighbours are all of opposite phase, so
   they cancel the pattern precisely, while a flat area passes through
   untouched. Diagonal neighbours are deliberately excluded — they share the
   centre's phase and would reinforce what we are trying to null.

   On its own it removes a third of the local variation on every portrait
   tried. It cannot tell a one-pixel pupil from one square of a checkerboard,
   so like the other smoothers it is applied through the dither detector rather
   than everywhere.

   Stray colour repair.

   Some resources carry isolated pixels in a wildly wrong hue — Erechtheus has
   69 magenta ones scattered over his face, from palette index 5 and the far
   end of the magenta ramp. They are quantisation accidents, not paint, and
   they are the most visually offensive thing left in the output because the
   eye finds an out-of-gamut dot instantly.

   Despeckle above will not do the job. It flags a pixel that is isolated and
   far from its neighbours in FULL COLOUR, and that is also an exact
   description of a pupil, which is why it takes the detail you wanted with it.

   The distinction that actually holds is hue. A pupil is extreme in
   brightness but its chroma matches its surroundings — it is a neutral dot in
   a neutral socket. A stray is extreme in chroma: it points somewhere in
   colour space that nothing near it points. Measured on Erechtheus, the
   magenta pixels sit 40 to 160 from their neighbourhood's median chroma;
   Pelagon's and Magpie's pupils sit at 0 to 15. The two populations do not
   overlap anywhere, so a threshold between them separates them completely.

   The isolation test is kept as a second condition so that a small but
   deliberate patch of colour — a gem, a coloured highlight — survives: only a
   pixel with no neighbour of its own hue is treated as an accident.

  /* Undo the drift that resampling adds to pixels the filter deliberately
     left alone.

     Zero blend weight is not enough by itself. A pixel the detector scored at
     zero comes out of the filter untouched, but the upscaler still resamples
     it and the downsample averages it with its neighbours, so it moves anyway.
     That is what was softening the Greek key on Erechtheus and turning the
     cream mat black on Pelagon.

     The weight to undo it by is the one already in hand: w = d * strength is
     exactly how much of this pixel was meant to change, so pulling the output
     back toward the pre-upscale result by (1 - w) restores an undithered pixel
     exactly, leaves a fully dithered one entirely alone, and slides smoothly
     between. No geometry, no threshold, and it follows the frame's real shape
     rather than a rectangle that would eat the face wherever the face reaches
     the edge. */

/* ------------------------------------------------------------
   The other direction: full colour IN, Cythera OUT.

   ditherToCytheraPalette is the deliberate inverse of the undither above.
   The undither's own analysis (see the checkerboard-notch comment) found
   that this artwork's dither is a checkerboard in WHICH RAMP each pixel is
   taken from -- greys interleaved with warm browns for skin, close in
   lightness, far in hue -- the single frequency (pi,pi). So the way to make
   an arbitrary image look like this artwork is to produce exactly that
   pattern: for each pixel, either the one palette entry nearest the target
   colour, or the better of a PAIR of entries laid out on the global
   checkerboard phase, whichever approximates it best. Pairs are ordered by
   luminance before the phase is applied, so a region that chooses the same
   pair renders as one coherent checker rather than pixel noise.

   Palette slots 0 (the transparent cut-out slot -- portraits sit on it) and
   0xE0-0xFB (the palette-cycling ramps the engine animates for lava, water
   and magic) are never chosen for opaque pixels unless asked; a portrait
   that borrowed an animated slot would shimmer with the sea.

   checker (0..1, default 0.6) sets how eagerly a pair beats a flat pixel:
   at 0 the result is plain nearest-colour quantisation; at 1 any pair that
   is at all better wins and everything shimmers with pattern.
